# Talal Amgad Shamaa 

## Education

KU Leuven, Groep T - Bachelor in Industrial Engineering, Electromechanical, (Automation)

Sep 2019 - present, Leuven, Belgium

## Relevant Engineering Experiences within the University Program

## Bachelor Thesis - Team Member

Witeeven Bos (The Company) had 2 workers to automate the process of extracting a 1.2 m soil-filled PVC liner from the ground, cutting, and scanning it. Samples were extracted from strategic positions, sealed, and shaken to extract gasses. A VOC sensor measured VOC levels, and interesting samples were kept for further investigation, while others were discarded. We were asked to automate the whole process starting from the extracted PVC liner. My engagement didn't involve control circuit design since I haven't taken the relative course at that moment compared to other master's students in my team who did so I was more mechanically inclined in that project.

## Piano Robot - Team Member

In this project we used a predefined electronic setting(2 DC motors, a basic PCB with its DAQ component and a lego-like for the mechanical system) to create a basic piano robot that will play a given musical note on the basic key panels. This project was an implementation of FSM(Finite State Machine) using graphical programming in Labview.

## Elevator - Team Member

Here we implemented the knowledge we gained in our more specialized Industrial Automation Courses, we controlled the elevator's Beckhoff drive using a PLC and an HMI was used to mimic the real life situation of the known elevator so buttons in the elevator with floor numbers, buttons with arrow in each floor to request the elevator, a panel with the elevators position, simulation of the door etc. They were programmed using TIA Portal and the program had to make the elevator prototype of our lab to act as real as the university's elevator, so it takes into account the elevator's position, order of requests etc.

## Languages

- Arabic (Egyptian dialect) is my mother tongue.
- English: Professional, Language of studying in school and university and the language I use for communicating in Belgium


## Programming Languages and other Relevant Programs

- Python, Java(OOP), Labview, Multisim, Solidworks, TIA Portal: Fundamental knowledge and adequate experience.
- Microsoft Excel, Word, PowerPoint: Well based and Experienced

Relevant Previous Jobs/Real Life Experiences, 3-5 weeks each(obviously except the first) Judo Player
Engaged in Judo from 2015 until Covid, developing soft skills from being the younger to the older/captain of the team and placed 5th position in Cairo twice showcasing determination and resilience and gaining expertise in time management, planning, and tactical thinking due to the technical nature of Judo.

## Student Engineer (PEC)

Received products from different companies, researched about their qualities(dimensions, technical drawings etc.) in order to identify and add them to the database/system of the company and add them to the stock in the workshop.

## Student Assembly/Logistics (Infrasensing)
