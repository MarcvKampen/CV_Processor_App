## Profile

Motivated Computer Science student with a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Analytics. Passionate about leveraging AI and data-driven approaches to solve complex problems and drive innovative solutions. Skilled in both research and production aspects, with a focus on extracting meaningful insights from data and developing intelligent systems to address real-world challenges.

## Education

## Master of science in computer science

In addition to my apprenticeships in NLP, I realized several academic projects including:

- Forest fire detection using advanced image classification models (VITs, EfficientNet, GoogleNet...). I also used YOLOv8 for the object detection task, and Grad-CAM for explicability.
- Monocular Depth Estimation and Point Cloud Generation for autonomous systems.
- Brain tumor segmentation using Autoencoders.
- Advanced machine learning project: Designed and implemented a movie recommender system leveraging multi-armed bandits in reinforcement learning to optimize personalized recommendations.
- Master Thesis (2024 - 2025): Investigating the intersection of Computer Vision and Explainable AI (XAI) challenges in medical imaging (using 2D images, extending to 3D images then to real time videos).


## Bachelor of science in computer science

Oct 2019 - Jun 2023
University of Liège, Liège
I realized several academic projects, including:

- Embedded systems project: In this project, my team and I chose to create an automatic emergency parachute. The goal was to develop a complete microcontrolled system. We used the PIC16/1789 microcontroller and assembly programming language
- Implementation of a client-server application using Java Sockets ( implemented in Java): In this project, we coded an application (the Monster Hunting game). In the first part of this project, we focused on the client-side implementation. In the second part, we implemented the server-side, with communications between distinct parts managed by the MQTT protocol (Standard for IoT messaging).
- Artificial Intelligence: We completed three projects (in sequence) related to implementing concepts for the Pacman game. The first project focused on search algorithms (DFS, BFS, A*). The second project involved implementing the Minimax and H-Minimax algorithms (with 3 different heuristics). The final project consisted of implementing a Bayes Filter to calculate Pacman's belief state about the ghosts' positions. All three projects were implemented in Python.
- Stochastic Processes: This project had two parts. The first part was more theoretical, involving definitions, proofs, and small calculations. The second part involved modelling the movement of game pieces in the game of Monopoly based on a Markov model and using this model to calculate various statistics about the game. For this project, we had the choice of programming language(s) to use. I used Mathematica for the first part and Python for the

## PROJECTS

22/09/2019 - 17/03/2020
Microstrip Antenna for medical applications Designed a microstrip antenna for medical applications. The antenna operates in the ISM frequency band (2.4Ghz). Compared to other conventional microstrip antennas, the design is much more compact while at the same time providing almost the same results. The simulated results provided a gain of -25 dB which is satisfiable for the compact size of the antenna. The results were finalized and recorded.

Augmented Reality module for Geolocation Created an AR module within 24 hours which displays locations and 3d popups of events ongoing at the local university culturals. Used Vuforia and Unity 3D to make it possible. This idea earned us 2nd place in the intra college Hackathon. The module was put into small scale production and helped students coming to the cultural event 'Instincts' with the locations and previews all in the palm of their hands.

## ACADEMIC PROJECTS

- My master thesis focusses on programming a torque controller for a Novel Wolfrom-based planetary gear train for a safe 'human-robot-interaction' application without the need for a torque sensor. The absence of the sensor drastically reduces the complexity, cost, size and weight of a drivetrain comprising an electric motor, gearbox and load. However, it makes the control scheme more involved and complicated. I was also asked to present my thesis during a Flanders Make conference in the form of a poster (Leon Borremans - SensoriessTorqueControl .postery.pdf).
- Mathematical model generation and optimization (book from MIT: 'Algorithms for Optimization') of different gripper designs for robotic manipulation of bricks (up to 120 kg ) with an implementation in CAD and DCM controller design.

## MASTER THESIS

## Battery Lifetime Prediction with Machine Learning

## - Objectives

This thesis project focuses on the growing concern surrounding the aging of lithiumion batteries (LIBs) amidst the rapid advancement of electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems (ESS). LIBs undergo aging due to a multitude of factors including material composition and manufacturing processes, which create challenges in managing LIB systems. Efforts have been made to estimate battery internal states and parameters using voltage, current, and temperature data to predict maximum available battery energy and power. This thesis aims to develop and assess a machine learning-based framework capable of predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of batteries under various operating conditions.

## - Methodology

The RUL function aims to predict a battery's expected lifetime, considering factors like cycles, electric range, or energy throughput before it reaches end-of-life, while also providing uncertainty bounds for a given application. The challenge lies in the complex interplay between battery operating conditions and aging, especially the nonlinear aging in later stages. This thesis tackles RUL prediction using data-driven methods such as Gaussian Process Regression, long short-term memory recurrent neural network, and random forest regression. The key tasks involve proposing a functional architecture incorporating state-of-health estimates, usage patterns, and predictive aging models; developing an adaptive estimation algorithm for online tuning of aging models; and thoroughly analyzing and verifying the performance across various load cycles and conditions.

## ABOUT ME

As an Electromechanical Engineer with focus on robotics and mechanical construction, I have developed a strong foundation in problem-solving, CAD design, programming, and mechanical systems. For my thesis with SAFEBOT (BruBotics - Imec), I used my Unity skills to develop an AR application and I am currently working on perceived safety to enhance human-robot interaction. Through my internship at Inter Production, I applied my knowledge in mechanics and gained hands-on experience in maintenance and preventive maintenance. I am looking for a challenging role in a reputable company to utilize my engineering skills that can contribute to the company's growth as well as enhance my knowledge by exploring new things.

ULB

## Experience

Master thesis in energy management and machine learning Sep 2024 - Jun 2025 ULB
In my final year thesis, I developed a methodology to disaggregate building energy consumption using machine learning techniques. My methodology identifies and analyses the energy usage of individual devices from overall consumption curves. I employed probabilistic techniques combined with machine learning to improve the accuracy of device recognition and power estimation. This project allowed me to apply advanced data processing and energy modelling techniques to promote more efficient energy management in buildings.

## PROJECTS

Master thesis

Infrared tomography

This work consists of Monte Carlo simulations of an electron crossing the interface between two materials. The main difficulty comes from the dependence on position, angle and energy of the cross-sections, and on optimizing the running time.

The goal was to design and construct an infrared tomography apparatus capable of performing a 2D scan of a polymer phantom. Part of the difficulty layed in the post-processing stage.
