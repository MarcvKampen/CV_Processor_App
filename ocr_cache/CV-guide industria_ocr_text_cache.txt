## Education

KU Leuven, Groep T - Bachelor in Industrial Engineering, Electromechanical, (Automation)

Sep 2019 - present, Leuven, Belgium

## Relevant Engineering Experiences within the University Program

## Bachelor Thesis - Team Member

Witeeven Bos (The Company) had 2 workers to automate the process of extracting a 1.2 m soil-filled PVC liner from the ground, cutting, and scanning it. Samples were extracted from strategic positions, sealed, and shaken to extract gasses. A VOC sensor measured VOC levels, and interesting samples were kept for further investigation, while others were discarded. We were asked to automate the whole process starting from the extracted PVC liner. My engagement didn't involve control circuit design since I haven't taken the relative course at that moment compared to other master's students in my team who did so I was more mechanically inclined in that project.

## Piano Robot - Team Member

In this project we used a predefined electronic setting(2 DC motors, a basic PCB with its DAQ component and a lego-like for the mechanical system) to create a basic piano robot that will play a given musical note on the basic key panels. This project was an implementation of FSM(Finite State Machine) using graphical programming in Labview.

## Elevator - Team Member

Here we implemented the knowledge we gained in our more specialized Industrial Automation Courses, we controlled the elevator's Beckhoff drive using a PLC and an HMI was used to mimic the real life situation of the known elevator so buttons in the elevator with floor numbers, buttons with arrow in each floor to request the elevator, a panel with the elevators position, simulation of the door etc. They were programmed using TIA Portal and the program had to make the elevator prototype of our lab to act as real as the university's elevator, so it takes into account the elevator's position, order of requests etc.

## Languages

- Arabic (Egyptian dialect) is my mother tongue.
- English: Professional, Language of studying in school and university and the language I use for communicating in Belgium


## Programming Languages and other Relevant Programs

- Python, Java(OOP), Labview, Multisim, Solidworks, TIA Portal: Fundamental knowledge and adequate experience.
- Microsoft Excel, Word, PowerPoint: Well based and Experienced

Relevant Previous Jobs/Real Life Experiences, 3-5 weeks each(obviously except the first) Judo Player
Engaged in Judo from 2015 until Covid, developing soft skills from being the younger to the older/captain of the team and placed 5th position in Cairo twice showcasing determination and resilience and gaining expertise in time management, planning, and tactical thinking due to the technical nature of Judo.

## Student Engineer (PEC)

Received products from different companies, researched about their qualities(dimensions, technical drawings etc.) in order to identify and add them to the database/system of the company and add them to the stock in the workshop.

## Student Assembly/Logistics (Infrasensing)

Tested, Fixed, and Assembled sensors in virtual collaboration with the R and D Engineers producing the final products to customers.

## Student Assembly (Soundtalks)

Engaged in the different aspects of the assembly line of the Soundtalks product which diagnoses animals.

## MASTER THESIS

I am currently developing a 3D zoetrope as part of my Master of ElectroMechanical Engineering. My research focuses on enhancing the interactive and immersive aspects of the zoetrope by integrating gesture control and augmented reality (AR) technologies. The project combines advanced mechanical design, parametric modeling, and precision manufacturing with cutting-edge human-computer interaction (HCI) techniques. The end goal is to deliver a functional prototype that offers a novel user experience and to present the research findings in a comprehensive report and live demonstration.

## OTHER INFORMATION

Until now, I have completed three university projects that increased my experience in teamwork as well as general knowledge of design and manufacturing processes. One of the projects entailed creating a machine that would fold and launch a paper airplane with the use of only mechanical components. Our team's project was praised for its simplicity and was one of the few that succeeded in the task.

## HOBBIES

My main hobbies include the automotive sector as well as technology in general. In addition to that for 12 years I have been a part of a semiprofessional swimming team and took part in a couple of national championships where I managed to get into the finals on some occasions.

## Wout Rubbrecht Student engineering technology

I am an athletic engineering student from Leuven who is actively involved in the academic community and enjoys spending time with friends. My passion for sports keeps me moving, while my social nature often involves me in social gatherings with friends. During my studies, I was an active member of a student union, where I developed my leadership skills and strengthened my involvement in the university community. My strong communication skills and persuasiveness enable me to inspire and convince others, making me a valuable team player and leadership figure within my university community.

2021 - 2024<br>Student association Industria vzw

Praeses
In my role as praeses of a student association in Leuven, I provided leadership and vision by shaping the direction and goals of the association. As a board member, I worked closely with fellow board members to make decisions and organise various events and activities, including festivals, lectures and sports events. My commitment to student representation in the field of education resulted in effective communication with university authorities and representing students' interests on important academic issues.

I have also played an active role in interacting with our members, acting as a point of contact for their concerns and ideas, and helping to foster a positive group atmosphere. I have been skilled in resolving internal conflicts and addressing challenges within the association. My leadership and organisational skills have contributed to my ability to communicate effectively and achieve goals in a team environment.

## Vice business relations

In my first two years at Industria, I was part of the corporate relations team, of which I was the person in charge during the academic year 2022 - 2023. As responsible for corporate relations in a student association in Leuven, my responsibilities include identifying and approaching potential corporate partners and sponsors, raising financial support, coordinating corporate sponsorship for events, building business networks, ensuring transparent communication with partners, budget management, developing a long-term corporate relations strategy, and organising a large-scale business fair with 170 participating companies. This crucial role contributes to the financial stability and sustainability of the association, while establishing and maintaining valuable relationships between the association, students and companies, as well as enabling the successful implementation of such a fair.

My master was focused on software systems with my master's thesis called "Machine Learning in Pelvic Rotation Detection". For this thesis, I collected the data and wrote the code for the machine learning.

## EXTENDED MASTER | SEP 2024 - JAN 2025 | POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY OF CARTAGENA

For my Erasmus exchange, I was completely free to choose the courses I wanted to do. I took some courses at the business faculty focused on managing and one course at the telecommunication faculty called "Network Security".

## Skills and Talents

## DATABASE MANAGEMENT

- I have had multiple courses where I have had to use and/or create databases. I have gotten very familiar with SQL this way.


## PROGRAMMING

- Programming is something that I am passionate about and enjoy doing. I have worked with multiple languages such as Python, Java, Javascript, C, and C++.


## TEAMWORK

- I have done multiple projects ranging from creating a distributed system to making hardware designs in a team and always did my best in contributing and communicating to achieve good results.


## Languages

- DUTCH: is my mother language.
- ENGLISH: I am fluent in English and have done projects solely in English before.
- FRENCH: I studied French for 10 years in middle and high school and can fluently read it. I can listen to it and speak it on a basic level.
