    prompt = f"""TASK: Extract structured information from CV documents with high precision and consistency.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Process each CV separately, identifying clear boundaries between different individuals.
- For each person, extract EXACTLY the 9 fields specified below.
- Double-check all extracted information for accuracy.
- Only include information that appears at least twice in the document or has strong supporting evidence.
- If information cannot be verified with high confidence or values don't match across checks, use "N/A" instead of guessing.
- Return data in a structured JSON array format, with one object per person.
- Do NOT include any explanatory text, headers, or additional formatting beyond valid JSON.

EXTRACTION FIELDS (9 required fields):

1. FIRST_NAME
   - Extract only the given/first name.
   - Verify spelling carefully.
   - If multiple first names, use only the first one.
   - Example: "John" from "John William Smith".

2. LAST_NAME
   - Extract only the family/last name.
   - Include all parts of compound surnames.
   - Example: "Smith-Johnson" should be kept as is.

3. EMAIL
   - Must follow standard email format (name@domain.tld).
   - Verify the domain exists (common domains: gmail.com, outlook.com, student.university.edu).
   - If no valid email is found, use "N/A".

4. PHONE_NUMBER
   - Include country code if available.
   - Standardize format if possible.
   - If no phone number is found, use "N/A".
   - If multiple phone numbers are found, use the one that starts with the country cod +32 or 04 or 4 (belgium). 

5. EDUCATION_LEVEL
   - STRICT HIERARCHY: Master > Academic Bachelor > Professional Bachelor > Secondary level.
   - "Master" - ANY master's degree (ongoing or completed).
   - "Academic Bachelor" - ONLY university bachelor's degrees.
   - "Professional Bachelor" - Non-university bachelor's degrees (colleges, institutes).
   - "Secondary level" - High school or equivalent.
   - Double-check educational institutions to correctly classify university vs. non-university.

6. EXPECTED_GRADUATION_YEAR
   - Format: 4-digit year (e.g., "{current_year}").
   - ONLY for the most recent educational program.
   - Use the year of the expected graduation, so the latest year of the program.
   - Must be EXPLICITLY stated in the document.
   - IMPORTANT: When you see "Present", "Now", "Current", or any variation (like "2023 - Present")
     in the education timeline, use "{current_year}" as the expected graduation year.
   - For standard educational programs with "current" or "present" status:
     * Bachelor's programs: typically add 3 years from the start date.
     * Master's programs: typically add 1-2 years from the start date.
   - If no information is found, use "N/A".

7. FACULTY
   - STRICTLY categorize into these fields ONLY:
   - Choose the facutly of the latest program, to achieve this use this logic: STRICT HIERARCHY: Master > Academic Bachelor > Professional Bachelor > Secondary level.
   - So most of the time it will be the faculty of the master program.
   - If no master program is found, then choose the faculty of the bachelor program.
   - If no bachelor program is found, then choose the faculty of the professional bachelor program.
   - If no professional bachelor program is found, then choose the faculty of the secondary level program.
   - If no secondary level program is found, then use "N/A".
   - YOU MUST CHOOSE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING 8 FACULTIES:
     OTHER IS NOT ACCEPTED.

8. NATIVE_LANGUAGE
   - Location: Focus on the "Skills" or "Languages" section of the CV.
   - Indicators: Look for terms like "Mother tongue," "Native," or "C2 level" to identify the native language.
   - Acceptable Languages: Only accept "Dutch," "French," "English," or "Other."
   - If the language is not explicitly listed as Dutch, French, or English, classify it as "Other."
   - If no language is specified or if the language does not meet the criteria, use "Other."
   - Proficiency Level: Note that C1 level is not sufficient for native classification; only C2 or explicit terms like "Native" or "Mother tongue" are acceptable.

   Examples:
   - English (Native): Accept as "English."
   - French (Mother tongue): Accept as "French."
   - Dutch (C2 level): Accept as "Dutch."
   - Spanish (C1 level): Classify as "Other."
   - Urdu (Native): Classify as "Other."

   Tips for Accuracy:
   - Keywords: Search for keywords such as "Native speaker," "Fluent," or "Bilingual" in conjunction with the language.
   - Context: Consider the context in which the language is mentioned. For example, if a candidate mentions being raised in a specific country, their native language might align with that country.
   - Consistency: Ensure consistency in classification by adhering strictly to the criteria provided.

9. LINKEDIN_PROFILE_URL
   - Location: Check the contact section, header, footer, or social media section of the CV.
   - Priority: Look specifically for a LinkedIn profile link first ("LinkedIn:"). If not found, then consider other professional networking platforms.
   - Valid Platforms: LinkedIn, Wefynd, Karamel, Shortlist, or personal websites. Always prioritize LinkedIn over other platforms.
   - URL Requirement: Ensure the URL is complete and includes the http:// or https:// prefix.
   - Identification: Look for icons or text that indicate professional networking sites, such as the LinkedIn logo or the word "LinkedIn."
   - Examples:
     - LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/username
     - Wefynd: https://wefynd.com/profile/username
     - Personal Website: https://www.username.com

SPECIAL CONTENT HANDLING:
- MULTILINGUAL DOCUMENTS: Extract data in the document's primary language, then translate field values to English.
- TABLES/CHARTS: Carefully examine for education history, work experience, or skill metrics.
- SCANNED DOCUMENTS: Watch for image quality issues affecting text recognition.
- LOGOS/ICONS: Use these as contextual clues for education institutions or professional platforms.

ADVANCED EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES:
- Use chronological analysis for education/career progression.
- Cross-reference contact information with name spelling.
- Use section headings as contextual guides (e.g., "Work Experience," "Education").
- When encountering inconsistencies, prioritize information from formal sections over casual mentions.

CV BOUNDARY RECOGNITION:
- Files often combine multiple CVs without clear separation.
- Key indicators of a new CV: new personal details section, page number resetting, distinct formatting changes.
- Watch for header text like "CV," "Resume," or "Curriculum Vitae" followed by a new name.
- Different document templates or styling often indicate a new person.

QUALITY ASSURANCE:
- VERIFY ALL EXTRACTIONS against multiple mentions in the document.
- For ambiguous cases, choose "N/A" rather than guessing.
- Ensure categorizations follow the strict hierarchies provided.
- Maintain consistency in field names and formatting.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return data as a valid JSON array where each object represents one person with the following format:
```json
[
  {{
    "FIRST_NAME": "...",
    "LAST_NAME": "...",
    "EMAIL": "...",
    "PHONE_NUMBER": "...",
    "EDUCATION_LEVEL": "...",
    "EXPECTED_GRADUATION_YEAR": "...",
    "FACULTY": "...",

    "LINKEDIN_PROFILE_URL": "..."
  }},
  {{
    "FIRST_NAME": "...",
    "LAST_NAME": "...",
    ...
  }}
]
```
Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted. Do not include any text before or after the JSON array.
